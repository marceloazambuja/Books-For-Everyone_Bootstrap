Hi,

thank you for downloading. Have fun and tell your friends about us ;)

Ondrej, Bootstrap Temple


CSS
----------

The theme stylesheet is css/style.default.css. If you want to make any changes, you can do it here or better to override it in custom.css so you can update the original theme stylesheet if an updated is released. 

Javascript
----------

Apart from the Bootstrap JS components, the majority of JS is located in /js/script.js. 

Google Map
----------

To make the Google map work on your site, you have to generate the Google Maps API key and replace it in the code. For more info have a look at my tutorial at https://bootstrapious.com/p/google-maps-and-bootstrap-tutorial.

Contact Form
----------

To make the Contact form work on your site, you have to provide a back-end solution in a language of your choice. For a PHP solution, check out  my tutorial at https://bootstrapious.com/p/how-to-build-a-working-bootstrap-contact-form.
